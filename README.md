This git repository houses my most important configuration files and scripts.
It's literally my home directory, I made it into a git repository.
I added a `*` to the `~/.git/info/exclude` file and use `git add -f` to add new files to it.

Most of this stuff was actually written by me. No copyright will be asserted.

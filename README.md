This git repository houses my most important configuration files and scripts.

Inspired by [this Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797), I have a bare git repository in `~/.config/dotfiles`, with my home directory as the working tree. I have added `*` to the `.git/info/exclude` file, and `git add -f` can be start tracking new files.
